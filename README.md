# ANN-Saturday-8Pm
Develop ANN for regression and classification using Tensor Flow 


# Tensorflow is Deep Learning Framework developed by Google. 
#We create neural networks using tensorflow and Keras 


# Simple Recap of Deep Leaning 

## Supervised 
* Artifical Neural network->  Regression and Classification 
* Recurrant Neural Network -> Sequential Data 
* Convolution Neural Network -> Imaging 

## Unsupervised 
* Self Organization Map.
* Deep Boltzman Machines
* Auto Encoders

# Workflow 

1. Collect a DataSet
   * Dataset with inputs + correct labels. -> ANN is Supervised.
2. Prprocess your data
   * Normalize the numbers using min max scaler
   * Split the data
     * Training (80%)
     * Testing (20%)
3. Build the model
   * Build the model
     * Define the number of inputs.
     * Define the number of neurons.
     * Define the hidden activation function.-> By default you can set as Relu activation function 
     * Define the output activation function
4. Compile and train the model
   * Define the Loss function
   * Activation function -> By defualt we can set as ADAM optimizer.
5. Evaluate and improve the accuracy of the validation /test set
